# Summary

The Debye scattering equation, derived in 1915 by Peter Debye, is used to calculate the scattering intensities considering the position of each atom in the structure:[@debye:1915; @scardi:2016]

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Debye}
I(Q) = \sum_{\( \nu \)=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_\( \nu \)f_j \frac{\sin(Qr_{\( \nu \)j})}{Qr_{\( \nu \)j}}
\end{equation}

In this equation, Q is the scattering vector, r~ij~ is the distance between atom-pair, \( \nu \) and j, and f is the atomic scattering factor. The Debye scattering equation can be used to compute the scattering pattern of any atomic structure and is commonly used to study both crystalline and non-crystalline materials with a range of scattering techniques like powder diffraction (PD), total scattering (TS) with pair distribution function (PDF) and small-angle scattering (SAS).[@scardi:2016] Although the Debye scattering equation is extremely versatile, its applicability has been limited by the double sum of the atoms in the structure which makes the equation computationally expensive to calculate. 
With the advancement in computing technology,[@schaller1997moore] new horizons have opened up for applying the Debye scattering equation to larger materials. Modern central processing Units (CPUs), ranging from tenths to hundreds of cores, offer an opportunity to parallelise the computation, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. This parallel architecture allows for the distribution of the double sum calculations across multiple cores. Graphics processing units (GPUs) further expand computational possibilities, consisting of hundreds or even thousands of smaller, more efficient cores designed for parallel processing.[@garland2008parallel] Unlike traditional CPUs, GPUs are ideally suited for calculations like the Debye scattering equation, where many computations can be performed simultaneously. By leveraging GPU acceleration, computational speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than even the most advanced multi-core CPUs are obtained.
We introduce a GPU-accelerated open-source Python package for rapid calculation of the scattering intensity from a xyz-file using the Debye scattering equation. The xyz-file format describes the atomic structure with the atomic identify and its xyz-coordinates and is commonly used in materials chemistry. We further calculate the PDF as described in Underneath the Bragg Peaks.[@egami2003underneath] We show that our software can simulate the PD, TS, SAS and PDF data orders of magnitudes faster than on the CPU, while being open-source and easily assessable from our GitHub (https://github.com/FrederikLizakJohansen/DebyeCalculatorGPU/tree/main).

The DebyeCalculator, illustrated in the pseudocode that follows, begins with an initialisation function that sets various parameters. These parameters are either user-defined or set to default. They include aspects of the computational environment (such as q-range, q-step, r-range, r-step, batch size, and device), atomic vibrations, radiation type, and instrumental parameters. During this initialisation phase, atomic form factor coefficients are loaded, tailoring the form factor calculation to the chosen radiation type. 
Once initialised, the DebyeCalculator can compute various quantities: the scattering intensity I(q) through the Debye scattering equation, the Total Scattering Structure Function S(q), the Reduced Total Scattering Function F(q), and the Reduced Atomic Pair Distribution Function G(r). In this section, we specifically illustrate the pseudocode for the G(r) calculation. This is because the process for G(r) inherently involves the calculations for I(q), S(q), and F(q). If the atomic structure has not been loaded, the DebyeCalculator loads the structure and computes the atomic form factors.[@Waasmaier:sh0059] Following this, it calculates the scattering intensity I(q) using the Debye scattering equation and subsequently determines the structure factor S(q). The function F(q) is derived using q-values and S(q). Necessary modifications, such as damping and the Lorch function, are applied before computing the G(r). Users have the flexibility to retain the results on the GPU or transfer them to the CPU. 
It is worth noting that the majority of the computational expense arises from the double sum calculation inherent in the Debye scattering equation. In order to take full advantage of parallel computing, we introduce a batch size parameter which determines the number of calculations processed simultaneously. Larger batch sizes generally lead to faster computation times as they can exploit the parallel nature of GPUs more effectively. However, it's essential to note that larger batch sizes consume more RAM, thereby necessitating better hardware. Consequently, users with more substantial GPU memory can accommodate even larger batch sizes and achieve even greater computation speeds.

In order to benchmark our implementation, we compare simulated scattering patterns from DebyeCalculator against DiffPy-CMI,[@juhas2015complex] which is a widely recognised software for scattering patterns computations. Here, our implementation obtains the same scattering patterns as DiffPy-CMI (Supporting Information), while being about three times faster on CPU (\autoref{fig:figure3}). Both calculations are run on a LLL CPU with a 004 batch size.
Shifting our calculations to the GPU provides another notable boost in speed (\autoref{fig:figure3}). This improvement primarily stems from the distribution of the double sum calculations across a more extensive set of cores than is feasible with the CPU. It is important to note the overhead associated with initiating GPU calculations. For atomic structures with fewer than 000 atoms, this overhead results in our GPU computations being slower than DiffPy-CMI and our CPU implementation. Once the atomic structure size exceeds this 000-atom threshold, we observe a speed-up using a blabla GPU and a batch size of 004. Specifically, 001 atoms onwards, the performance gain is on the order of 002 times.
The choice of GPU hardware has a substantial influence on this speed advantage. As demonstrated in Figure 1, using a KKK GPU, which offers XXX GB of RAM enabling a batch size of 004, the speed benefits become even more evident. Beyond the same 000-atom threshold, the KKK GPU delivers a performance that is two orders of magnitude faster, underscoring the significant role of the hardware. With the advancements of GPUs like NVIDIA's Grace Hopper Superchip[@NVIDIA], which boasts 576GB of fast-access GPU memory, there is potential for DebyeCalculator to achieve even greater speeds in the future.

# Statement of need

Several software packages already exist for simulating the Debye scattering equation, including DiffPy-CMI,[@juhas2015complex] debyer,[@debyer] Debussy,[@cervellino2010debussy; @cervellino2015debussy] TOPAS,[@coelho2018topas] and BCL::SAXS.[@putnam2015bcl] Our software distinguishes itself in several ways. Firstly, it is freely available and open-source licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Moreover, it is conveniently implemented as a â€˜pipâ€™ install package and has been integrated with Google Colab (https://github.com/FrederikLizakJohansen/DebyeCalculatorGPU/blob/main/quickstart/QuickStart.ipynb), allowing users to rapidly calculate the Debye scattering equation without the need of local software installations. At the same time, our software is fast, and GPU accelerated. Crucially, our software is optimised for speed and outputs both I(Q), S(Q), F(Q) and G(r).
