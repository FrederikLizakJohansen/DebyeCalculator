# I(Q)

The Debye scattering equation is used to calculate scattering intensities from atomic structures considering the position of each atom in the structure:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Debye}
I(Q) = \sum_{\nu=1}^{N} \sum_{\mu=1}^{N} b_{\nu} b_{\mu} \frac{\sin(Qr_{\nu\mu})}{Qr_{\nu\mu}}
\end{equation}

In this equation $Q$ is the momentum transfer of the scattered radiation, $N$ is the number of atoms in the structure, and $r_{\nu\mu}$ is the distance between atoms $\nu$ and $\mu$. For X-ray radiation, the atomic form factor, $b$, depends strongly on $Q$ and is usually denoted as $f(Q)$, but for neutrons, $b$ is independent of $Q$ and referred to as the scattering length.
